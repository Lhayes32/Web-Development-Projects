#Web Development Projects

##Naming Scheme
A typical name for a folder in this repository will follow this scheme

>{'WD' | 2}{PROJECT_TYPE | 2}{PROJECT_LANG | 1}{PROJECT_NUM | 3}

Where PROJECT_TYPE is the type of project, PROJECT_LANG is the primary language(s) the project uses, and PROJECT_NUM is the number of the project in this repository.
In some cases there will be a '_IP' at the end of a folder. This means it is currently in progress.


**PROJECT_TYPE's:**
- PA: Specifies a personal project that is only for practice and is more than likely an incomplete project.
- PE: Specifies a personal project that is only for practice but is complete (complete UI or a fully functional website).
- PR: Specifies a professional project that was either commissioned or I am currently using professionally. 

**PROJECT_LANG's:**
- X: Either HTML, CSS, or Javascript
- P: Python
- F: Flutter
